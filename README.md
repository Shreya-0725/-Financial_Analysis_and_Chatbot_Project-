## BCG GenAI Job Simulation on Forage ‚Äì May 2025

Completed a job simulation involving AI-powered financial chatbot development for **BCG's GenAI Consulting team** on **Forage**.  
Gained experience in Python programming, including the use of libraries such as pandas for data manipulation.  
Integrated and interpreted complex financial data from **10-K** and **10-Q** reports of Apple, Microsoft, and Tesla, employing rule-based logic to create a chatbot that provides user-friendly financial insights and analysis.

## Objective

The goal of this project was to perform a financial trend analysis on three major companies and then create an AI-powered chatbot capable of answering predefined financial queries based on that analysis.  
This project aims to provide financial insights using Python programming, data analysis with pandas, and AI chatbot development using simple rule-based logic.

## What I Have Done

### üîπ Financial Trend Analysis

- Analyzed the financial data of three companies: **Apple**, **Microsoft**, and **Tesla**
- Calculated **Year-over-Year Growth** for financial indicators like Revenue, Net Income, Assets, Liabilities, and Cash Flow
- Performed additional analysis using:
  - **Net Income Margin**
  - **Debt-to-Asset Ratio**
  - **Average Cash Flow Growth**

### üîπ AI Chatbot Development

- Developed a **rule-based AI chatbot** using Python
- Programmed to answer specific financial questions based on the data analysis
- Sample questions handled by the bot:
  - *What is the total revenue?*
  - *How has net income changed over the last year?*
  - *What is the debt-to-asset ratio for Apple?*
