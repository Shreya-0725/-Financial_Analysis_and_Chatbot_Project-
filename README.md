# Financial_Analysis_and_Chatbot_Project-
"A comprehensive project that includes financial trend analysis of three companies using Python and Jupyter Notebook, followed by the development of an AI chatbot for answering financial queries based on the analysis."

## Objective:
The goal of this project was to perform a financial trend analysis on three major companies and then create an AI-powered chatbot capable of answering predefined financial queries based on that analysis. This project aims to provide financial insights using Python programming, data analysis with pandas, and AI chatbot development using simple rule-based logic.

## What I Have Done:
1. **Financial Trend Analysis**:
   - Analyzed the financial data of three companies: **Apple**, **Microsoft**, and **Tesla**.
   - Used the data to calculate Year-over-Year Growth for financial indicators like Revenue, Net Income, Assets, Liabilities, and Cash Flow.
   - Performed additional profitability and financial risk analysis using metrics like Net Income Margin and Debt-to-Asset Ratio.

2. **AI Chatbot Development**:
   - Developed a basic AI chatbot using Python that can respond to predefined financial queries.
   - The chatbot uses rule-based logic to provide responses based on the insights derived from the financial analysis of the three companies.
   - Implemented the chatbot to answer questions such as "What is the total revenue?" or "How has net income changed over the last year?"

## Companies Included:
- **Apple**
- **Microsoft**
- **Tesla**

## Insights and Analysis:
- **Year-over-Year Financial Growth**: Analyzed the growth in key financial metrics such as revenue, net income, assets, liabilities, and cash flow for the three companies.
- **Net Income Margin**: Calculated profitability by determining how much net income is generated as a percentage of total revenue.
- **Debt to Asset Ratio**: Evaluated financial risk by calculating the proportion of assets financed by debt.
- **Average Cash Flow Growth**: Analyzed the average change in operating cash flow for each company over the years.

## Job Simulation with BCG:
- **Completed a job simulation** involving AI-powered financial chatbot development for **BCG's GenAI Consulting team**.
- **Gained experience in Python programming**, including the use of libraries such as pandas for data manipulation.
- Integrated and interpreted complex financial data from **10-K** and **10-Q reports** of **Apple**, **Microsoft**, and **Tesla**, employing rule-based logic to create a chatbot that provides user-friendly financial insights and analysis.

## Data Sources:
- The financial data used in this project was sourced from publicly available **10-K** and **10-Q** reports of the three companies: **Apple**, **Microsoft**, and **Tesla**. These reports provide detailed financial statements, which were processed and analyzed to generate insights.

## Tools and Technologies:
- **Python** (pandas, numpy)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **AI Chatbot Development**: Rule-based logic using Python
- **Data Analysis**: Financial trend analysis using pandas for data manipulation
- **GitHub** for version control and repository management

## Conclusion:
This project not only allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of financial data analysis but also helped me develop an AI chatbot capable of providing real-time financial insights. The integration of both fields gave me hands-on experience in data-driven decision-making and conversational AI development.
